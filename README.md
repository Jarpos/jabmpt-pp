# jabmpt-pp - Just Another BMP Thing - PlusPlus
Me trying to play around with [BMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format) pictures and doing some transformations on them.

This is very, very heavily inspired by [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/)s [Problem Set 4](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/4/filter/more/), in which the task is to implement multiple filters that are applied to pictures using [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29), while here I am doing it using [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B).
